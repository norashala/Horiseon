# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description 

The motivation behind this project is to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards while also correcting the HTML and CSS elements. In order to make this webiste accesable and functional, I structured the HTML elements so they can follow a logical structure the image elements contain accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order. And there is a concise and secriptive title.
